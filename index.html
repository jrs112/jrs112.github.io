	<p> <img class="portfolio-image" src="assets/images/JRheadshot.jpg" alt="JR Pic">  Welcome to my Website!  My name is John Ryan Sander and I'm a programmer in training at the University of North Carolina Charlotte Coding Bootcamp.  I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina and then went to attain a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science at Randolph Macon College in Ashland, Virginia.</p>

	<p>After graduating college, I did financial sales with New York Life where I was able to gain great experience in both marketing and sales.  I then moved back to Charlotte and worked as an Account Manager with Flores and Associates where I was able to develop excellent customer service and client relationship skills.  These past experiences allowed me to develop excellent communication skills that will be valuable as I pursue my dream of becoming a web developer.  </p>

  	<p>The University of North Carolina Charlotte Coding Bootcamp is teaching me a full stack web development skillset that will prepare me to become a web developer.  The full stack web development skillset that I'm learning includes: 
  	  <ul>
  	    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
  	    <li>JavaScript</li>
  	    <li>asp.Net</li>
  	    <li>Bootstrap</li>
  	    <li>Node.js</li>
  	  </ul>
      </p>  

	<p>I will also be putting together a portfolio from all of the projects that I complete during the Bootcamp.  This portfolio will demonstrate the skillset that I develop during the Bootcamp and show potential employers what I am capable of.  You can view my current portfolio by clicking the "Portfolio" link towards the top right of the screen.</p>
